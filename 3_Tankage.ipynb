    "* Use the table of contents icon and sidebar at the left to navigate to the topics of interest.\n",
    "* Change any of the input values and run the associated cell code.\n",
    "* If an interactive Binder web browser session is being used, the original file will not be altered. Therefore, if you wish to retain any modifications you make, save your file to local memory on your device.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAUTION:** None of the code cells run automatically. The user must manually run selected code cells in sequence to achieve the desired results. Default units are SI.\n",
