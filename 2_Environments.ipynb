    "The environments that a spacecraft is exposed to are a function of the mission segment and ConOps. CFM is strongly impacted by the corresponding induced acceleration and thermal sources and sinks. An understanding and characterization of these environments is essential for identifying key CFM drivers, and for making appropriate system design and operational trades. NASA SLS-SPEC-159 provides comprehensive definition of natural environments relevant for all space exploration systems development."
